BitMatrix provides an efficient bit matrix implementation.

This is inspired by Kjeld Petersen's BinMatrix implementation (https://senseis.xmp.net/?BinMatrix#diag6).

The BitMatrix can be used as an efficient data structure for the implementation of boardgames where are there are two types of stones, like Go, Checkers, Othelo, Connect4.
